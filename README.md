# Miguel Callejón Cantero
MSc Aerospace Engineering student at Delft University of Technology
(TUDelft), after graduating at Technical University of Madrid (UPM).
Very interested in space from both a scientific and technologic point of
view, currently studying the Space Exploration profile. Strong
team-working, assertivity, communication, and drive skills as my commit
to students'associations can prove. Looking for upcoming challenges
which can broaden my knowledge and working experience.

## Technical Experience


### INTERN ADVANCED CONCEPTS TEAM (ACT) 08 2020 - 10 2020


*European Space Agency (ESA) Noordwijk, Zuid Holland, The Netherlands*

-   Main task: create and develop optimization challenges in the web
    platform [optimize](https://optimize.esa.int/).

-   Three challenges created: Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE),
    Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and interferometry:

    -   JUICE: trajectory optimization problem of a spacecraft that
        orbits through the Jovian system, based on the homonym mission.

    -   TSP: classical optimization problem applied to a hypothetical
        mission that shall remove space debris with the least possible
        fuel consumption. The debris pieces were those recovered from
        the collision of satellites Iridium-33 and Cosmos-2251, and
        Fengyun-1C destruction.

    -   Interferometry: Using an array of telescopes, it is required to
        find the position that would maximize image reconstruction of
        the sky, variating the initial position of the array. It
        resembles similarity to a two-dimensional Golomb ruler, as only
        the difference in position between the telescopes influences the
        final similarity.

## Education


### Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering 09 2019 -

*Technical University of Delft (TUDelft) Delft, Zuid Holland, The
Netherlands*

-   Specialization: Space Flight, Space Exploration

-   Key courses: Multi-Disciplinary Optimization; Astrodynamics,
    Optimization in Astrodynamics, Numerical Astrodynamics, Mission
    Geometry and Orbit Design, Planetary Sciences, Space Systems
    Engineering.

-   Key projects:

    -   Preliminary design of a *scientific mission to explore the
        centaur Chariklo*.

    -   Systems requirements analysis of an *asteroid mining mission*:
        mission and need statement, stakeholders analisys, acceptance
        criteria, concept design, and risk analysis.

    -   Design of an *Earth Observation mission* required to analyse
        sea-level variance for a span of 10 years.
        Ground-repeating-tracks were used, as well as a literature
        research to find similar missions, and design trades.

    -   *Shape Design Optimization of an Earth re-entry system*:
        propagating the equations of motion, finding the most suitable
        numerical integrator and propagator, to find the shape with the
        best compromise between three objectives: minimize the heat load
        on the vehicle, maximize its payload volume, and maximize the
        ground track of the system during re-entry.

-   Literature study: Application of Taylor Series Integration to an
    astrodynamics trajectory to a binary asteroid system such as HERA.

### Grado en Ingeniería Aeroespacial 09 2015 -- 07 2019
