\justifying

MSc Aerospace Engineering student at Delft University of Technology (TUDelft), after graduating at Technical University of Madrid (UPM). Very interested in space from both a scientific and technologic point of view, currently studying the Space Exploration profile. Robust mathematical abstraction capabilities and deep understanding of metaheuristic algorithms proven by previous experience in optimisation projects. Strong team-working, assertivity, communication, and drive skills as my commit to studentsâ€™associations can prove. Looking for upcoming challenges which can broaden my knowledge and working experience.
