\justifying

MSc Aerospace Engineering student at Delft University of Technology (TUDelft), after graduating at Technical University of Madrid (UPM). Very interested in space from both a scientific and technologic point of view, currently studying the Space Exploration profile. Strong team-working, assertivity, communication, and drive skills as my commit to studentsâ€™associations can prove. Looking for upcoming challenges which can broaden my knowledge and working experience.
